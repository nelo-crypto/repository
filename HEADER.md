# Repository

A public repository, in PDF format, for the information I find useful and interisting over the internet. Mostly crypto and security related topics with some odd stuff.

## Goals

* Keep useful information out of the _Invisible Web_
* Keep good content pieces as long-term artifacts (PDF files), unaltered by future layout / structural changes
* Implement index generation software
